## Project Description

The project involves building a predictive model to determine the probability of loan approval based on various features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more. The project follows a typical machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication). It contains several features related to the applicants' demographic and financial information:

- **Loan_ID**: Unique Loan ID
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Married**: Applicant married (Y/N)
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents
- **Education**: Applicant Education (Graduate/Undergraduate)
- **Self_Employed**: Self-employed (Y/N)
- **ApplicantIncome**: Applicant income
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Coapplicant income
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount in thousands
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of loan in months
- **Credit_History**: Credit history meets guidelines (1/0)
- **Property_Area**: Urban/Semi Urban/Rural
- **Loan_Status**: Loan approved (Y/N)

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubh123a3/Loan-Approval-Model.git
cd Loan-Approval-Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the project by executing the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Development

The model development process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features that might help improve model performance

3. **Model Training**:
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Training multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Cross-validation to ensure model robustness

## Results

The final model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

- **Accuracy**: X.XX
- **Precision**: X.XX
- **Recall**: X.XX
- **F1-Score**: X.XX

(Replace X.XX with actual values)

## Conclusion

The Loan Approval Model demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting loan approval decisions. By leveraging various features and employing robust preprocessing and model training techniques, the project showcases how data-driven approaches can enhance decision-making in the financial sector.
